# ZEUS ENTERPRISE — FULL-SPECTRUM AI-NATIVE OS
## FINAL EXECUTION BLUEPRINT (LOCKED)

This repository is a **complete, ordered, non-ambiguous execution blueprint**.
It is designed so that **any competent human team or AI** can build it **without guessing**,
**without skipping steps**, and **without losing progress**.

This is NOT an idea document.
This is an execution contract.

---

## HOW TO START (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You MUST follow phases **in order**.
You are NOT allowed to jump phases.
You are NOT allowed to assume missing information.

If something is required that is NOT in the blueprint:
1. STOP
2. WRITE IT DOWN in `/docs/execution/OPEN_ITEMS.md`
3. REQUEST INPUT FROM OWNER
4. ONCE ANSWERED, CONTINUE FROM LAST COMPLETED POINT

---

## EXECUTION PHASE ORDER (LOCKED)

PHASE 0 – Foundational Lock-In (100 pts)
PHASE 1 – AI-Native OS Kernel (200 pts)
PHASE 2 – Scheduler & Budget Enforcement (150 pts)
PHASE 3 – Memory Graph & Chat System (150 pts)
PHASE 4 – Autonomy & Self-Repair Loop (150 pts)
PHASE 5 – Admin Panel & Patch System (150 pts)
PHASE 6 – Security & Family Safety Hardening (100 pts)

TOTAL: 1,000 / 1,000 points

---

## PROGRESS REPORTING (MANDATORY)

All status updates MUST be reported using this exact format:

```
PHASE COMPLETION:
- Phase X: YY%

TASK COMPLETION:
- Task A: YY%
- Task B: YY%

TOTAL PROJECT COMPLETION:
- ZZ%

CHANGES SINCE LAST REPORT:
- Bugs fixed:
- Errors encountered:
- Patches applied:
- Decisions made:

OPEN ITEMS:
- (List unanswered questions blocking progress)
```

Failure to report progress this way = FAILED EXECUTION.

---

## DOCUMENTATION RULES (ABSOLUTE)

You MUST document:
- Every bug
- Every error
- Every fix
- What caused it
- What fixed it
- When it happened
- What phase it belonged to

Documentation locations:
- `/docs/execution/WORK_LOG.md`
- `/docs/execution/BUGS.md`
- `/docs/execution/PATCHES.md`
- `/docs/execution/DECISIONS.md`

Nothing lives in chat.
Nothing lives in memory.
If it is not written, it does not exist.

---

## END CONDITION

When ALL phases reach 100%:
1. Generate `/docs/final/FINAL_PRODUCT_BLUEPRINT.md`
2. Update `/docs/final/ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md`
3. Freeze this repository
4. Tag as FINAL

This ensures:
- Zero loss if a machine crashes
- Zero loss if a team changes
- Zero ambiguity for future builders

---

## OWNER INTENT (READ ONCE)

This system exists to:
- Protect the owner and their family
- Generate sustainable income
- Remain under owner control at all times

Any design choice that violates this intent is INVALID.


---

## AI AGENTS (RUNPOD AUTONOMOUS MODE)
If you are an AI agent, you MUST read and follow:
- `docs/execution/AI_AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md`

Cost rule (hard): **Total spend must be <= $1000**. Defaults enforce per-run caps.
